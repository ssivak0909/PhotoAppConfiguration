This is the commit in which i added all the final changes
Tags are ref's that point to specific points in git history. 
Tagging is generally used to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release(i.e. v1.0.1)
Tag is used to highlight/label a particular commit

Commands:
git tag<tag_name>
git tag --list
git tag --delete <tag_name>

#Annotated tag
$ git tag -a <tag_name>
(now it will ask tag message, so give something like "Release 1 code Freeze")
To see Tag info
$ git show <tag_name> (but this is applicable only for Annotated tags, it wont show any info for lightweight tags)

#once you created atag , it will be automatically tagged to the latest (or last) commit
why we use tags
for ex , this week we committed version1.0 and next week we are going to commit version2.0
if we attach tags to these committs we can easily comapare the changes btw those
