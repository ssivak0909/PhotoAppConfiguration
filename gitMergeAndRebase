dev$ git merge master -m "merging from master"
#on top of all dev committs, it will add master's commits
# Ex:  1st u change temp9 file and commit in master branch
# and you come to dev branch and change temp6 file (change some file and commit) and commit into dev branch
#now run this command 
dev$ git merge master -m "merging from master"
#and check logs 
dev$ git log --oneline --graph    
#it will display master commits on top of dev's commits even though, you 1st committed changes in master
